# Installation and Configuration

## Steps

Run the following commands in your terminal:

Clone the repository to your project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/rest-api-authentication.git
```

Install all packages and include `node_modules` to your project.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the server (in developement)

- with nodemon

```bash
npm start
```

- without nodemon (with node)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Debug for development included in both cases.

Run the server (in production)

- without nodemon (with node)

```bash
npm run prod
```

### Testing

Testing the server

- Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to test your routes based on request on the server.
- Download and connect to mongoDB with either [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) or [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register).

### Ignored Files

Include the following files:

`/bin/.env`

Replace each placement, `<...>` with their actual values.

```
DATABASE=<databasename>
PASSWORD=<password>
USERNAME=<username>
PORT=<port>
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Note!
- When hosting to a platform like [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), you need to remove the port environment variable, `PORT=<port>` and the node environment variable, `NODE_ENV=development` from the `.env` file

### prettierrc

Prettier prettifies your code but you can override the default configuration of prettier. See the example below:

`.prettierrc`

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 79,
  "arrowParens": "avoid"
}
```

#### Note!
- For the case of this project remove the `"singleQuote": true` and `"arrorwParens": "avoid"` in order to use their default prettier configuration

Read more on [prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).

### eslintrc

If you want suggestions on your code for better code practices and linting (highlighing/checking) of errors and warnings with ease then eslint is the way. See the example below:

`.eslintrc`

```json
{
  "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "plugin:node/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "error",
    "spaced-comment": "off",
    "no-console": "off",
    "consistent-return": "off",
    "func-names": "off",
    "object-shorthand": "off",
    "no-process-exit": "off",
    "no-param-reassign": "off",
    "no-return-await": "off",
    "no-underscore-dangle": "off",
    "class-methods-use-this": "off",
    "prefer-destructuring": ["error", { "object": true, "array": false }],
    "no-unused-vars": ["error", { "argsIgnorePattern": "req|res|next|val" }]
  }
}
```

### Note!

- If you want to use eslint in your next project, install the below dev dependency packages

```bash
npm i -D eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-node eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react
```
- Replace `npm i` for `yarn add` if you are using yarn registry.
